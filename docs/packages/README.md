# Packages Index

Here you can find the documentation
for the laravel-enso v2.x packages, that contain both the back-end and front-end components.

Starting with v3.x, after a thorough rewrite & refactor, we will migrate to to a different structure, 
where most of the front-end components will be available from NPM.

To get all the details about a package select the corresponding option from the sidebar.
